# Group Project 

## Project Description

The purpose of the project is for you to explore how revenue management principles and
techniques learned in class can be applied to real business problems. The topic of the project is
flexible. I suggest a few strategies, but they are not restrictive.
• RM Consultant: Choose a (local) business where revenue management has potential.
Investigate and analyze the level of revenue management practiced, if at all. Propose
concrete strategies to develop and enhance these practices in the specific business context.
• Business Analyst: Choose a generic business (e.g. accommodation, travel, entertainment,
food services, media advertising, cargo, telecom, etc.). Gather information from a few
companies in this business, and do a comparative study of the RM practices and
opportunities in this sector. Propose innovative strategies and discuss implementation.
• Genius: Propose, investigate, and speculate on the impact of a new type of revenue
management concept or process on an existing business.

## Deliverables
• For your project report, please include your problem description, the methodologies
you’ve used, and your findings/results/recommendations.
• The assessment will be based on both the quality of your overall analysis and the
expositional clarity of your report. Depending on the type of project (as mentioned above)
you choose, the quality of analysis may include factors such as the suitableness and
correctness of the incorporated methodologies to your particular problem, the depth of
your analysis (e.g., it should not be very similar to or at the level of a problem set question),
and the strength of your reasoning regarding your recommendations.
• There is no requirement for you to collect data, you can also work entirely with simulated
data. Please provide sufficient justifications for all your assumptions. If you already have
data that you think might be suitable, you can work with that as well.
• For your project report, please submit a single pdf file per group to Moodle. The main
project report should be limited to 4 pages (approximately limit to a maximum of 2000
words). You can provide additional details on your analysis, calculations, etc., as an
Appendix.
• In addition to the report, please make sure you also submit your codes (preferably, a single
code file that is ready to run either as a whole or in parts).
