Consequently, the module will regularly utilize software (primarily R) to incorporate applications of these methods.

Overall, the module will also expose students to several fundamental analytical methodologies such as linear programming, nonlinear optimisation, stochastic dynamic programming, Markov decision processes, simulation, maximum likelihood estimation, and (Bayesian) multi-armed bandit problems.
